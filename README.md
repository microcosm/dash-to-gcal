mega-cycles-gcal
================
Syncs tasks from _mega—_, a task management GSheet, into pre-made _mega—_ Gcalendars to make them easier to schedule and complete.

The script reads from "Todo" and "Cycles" tabs of the _mega—_ Gsheet whenever a relevant edit is detected, and also once every 24 hours shortly after midnight EST.
