_Pronounce: "gsheet-dash"_

Extends a Google Spreadsheet into an activity management dashboard. To use, combine the [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/sheets) in this repo with some [data validation](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/186103) and [conditional formatting](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/78413). This approach allows you to leverage the extensability and simplicity of customizable Google Sheets, tailoring it to various specific task-management contexts.

There are specific caveats on the usefulness of this approach:
1. Editing doesn't scale well past a couple of heavy users (for viewers however there is no upper bound)
2. You need at least one person with spreadsheet and/or scripting skills to look after it

However the benefit is the ability to administrate in one place different contextual domains that often otherwise have entire systems associated with them, like timeline planning or personnel, task or interaction management. Using a spreadsheet as a dashboard allows relative platform independence and customisable feature configuration and extensibility.

- List features here

How to use
===
To implement this dashboard for a spreadsheet, create a new repo and add this repo [as a submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). Create a `.gs` file which for custom configuration, and create standard functions like so:

```javascript
function getSpreadsheetConfig() {
  return {
    name: 'the name of your implementation',
    id: 'the spreadsheet ID you are attaching it to'
  };
}
```

Below that, create the methods which define which values sheets and feature sheets will be in use by the dashboard:

```javascript
function getValuesSheetConfig() {
  return {
    name: 'Values', //the name of the sheet
    range: 'A3:A5',
    usersColumnIndex: 0 //the index within the range which contains user information
  };
}

function getFeatureSheetConfigs() {
  return [
    this.getProjectsSheet(),
    this.getTasksSheet(),
    this.getTimelineSheet()
  ];
}

function getProjectsSheet() {
  return {
    name: 'Projects',
    features: { //this feature copies a entire sheet to an external sheet whenever the it is edited
      sheetToExternalSheet: {
        destinationSpreadsheetID: 'destination spreadsheet id',
        destinationSheetName: 'destination sheet name'
        //other config
      }
    }
  };
}

function getTasksSheet() {
  return {
    name: 'Tasks',
    sidebar: { //this shows a sidebar allowing custom interactions with the sheet through features
      guidance: {
        type: 'text', title: 'Usage Guidance',
        text: 'Guidance text for users'
      },
      arrange: {
        type: 'buttons', title: 'Arrange by',
        features: {
          orderMainSection: { //this feature reorders the main content section of the sheet
            by: {
              timing: [{ column: 'D', direction: 'ascending' }, { column: 'B', direction: 'ascending' }],
              workStream: [{ column: 'B', direction: 'ascending' }, { column: 'D', direction: 'ascending' }]
            }
          }
          //other config
        }
      }
    }
  };
}

function getTimelineSheet() {
  return {
    name: 'Timeline',
    features: { //this feature updates a sheet from a specified google calendar
      CalendarEventsToSheet: {
        fromDate: 'March 29, 2021',
        dateColumn: 'C'
        //other config
      }
    }
  };
}
```

Features specified under `features` at the top level of the config are set up for responding to sheet edits or timed events. Features specified under `sidebar.controlName.features` are set up for sidebar user interaction events.

How it runs
===
Google Apps Script is stateless, meaning ([almost](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/properties)) all the state exists as data on the spreadsheet. Executions are triggered by user events, like opening or editing a file in a browser, by system events like [timers](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable), or by button clicks on the sidebar.

Events are handled by event handler methods in `main.gs`, all of which take the following form:

1. Build relevant state
2. Execute relevant features

State is built in chunks, with only the relevant state built by each event handler. Part of state building is pulling in config values, via a call to `getFeatureSheetConfigs()`.

Features are bound 1:1 to sheets, meaning there are often two or more instances of the same feature with each interacting with different sheets. Each feature registers itself as capable of responding to a subset of events for which they make sense. For example:

- The `ReplicateSheetInExternalSpreadsheet` feature syncs changes from a source sheet to a target sheet -- therefore it is capable of responding to `onSpreadsheetEdit`
- The `UpdateSheetHiddenValue` feature updates a hidden cell, typically triggering a UI change, typically requiring a human input -- therefore it is capable of responding to `onSidebarSubmit`

Event handlers methods in `main.gs` compile a list of "registered" features based on these capabilities, and send event data to each of them to assess whether they should be marked for execution.

Part of the event data sent for assessment is the triggering sheet name, i.e. when a user clicks a sheet-relative sidebar button or edits a sheet's cell. In these instances each registered feature compares the event data sheet name against its 1:1 sheet property to determine if it should execute. It then inspects the remaining event data to determine if it is valid for an execution.

Features that respond positively for execution are added to an execution list, sorted into priority order, and then executed.

Timed events have no event data and therefore the registration list is the execution list, with features executing across multiple sheets as part of the same run.

Glossary
===
The terminology used in this repo matches and extends the [standard terminology](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts) used in Google Sheets, including:

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Spreadsheet | A Google Sheets file. The primary object in Google Sheets that can contain multiple sheets, each with structured information contained in cells. |
| Sheet | A page or tab within a spreadsheet. |
| SpreadsheetID and SheetID | Like all Google Apps services, files are represented by a top-level alphanumeric ID, i.e. a "Spreadsheet ID". Each sheet inside a spreadsheet is represented by a unique title and numeric value, i.e. a "Sheet ID". These can both be found in the resource URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[SpreadsheetID]/edit#gid=[SheetID]` |
| Cell | An individual field of text or data within a sheet.
| Row, Column and Range |Cells are arranged in rows and columns, and can be grouped together as a range of cells.

To help shape the spreadsheet into a dashboard-like interface, the standard terms are extended with combinations and more specific terms:
| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ValuesSheet | The single sheet containing user-configurable configuration values. |
| FeatureSheet | A sheet to which a registered feature should be applied. |
| Widget | A range within a Sheet representing a uniform set of labeled user interface elements, like a table or a set of controls. Many sheets have only one Widget, some have two or more which are grouped because they are conceptually related and easier for users to see in one place. |
